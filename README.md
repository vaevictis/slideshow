# Programming Exercise - Slideshow

The goal of this exercise is to build a simple slideshow.

 - display the images provided in the images folder
 - track how many times each picture is viewed (does not need to be stored between refreshes)

## Installation instructions

I built this project with `Parcel-bundler` because I still wanted a web app bundler but I was interested to test this alternative to Webpack for a long while.
- `cd` into this directory
- `yarn` or `npm install`
- `yarn dev`
- Point your browser to [the local server](localhost:1234)
